# asana.model.event_response.EventResponse

An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was observed by an event subscription or delivered asynchronously to the target location of an active webhook.  The event may be triggered by a different `user` than the subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B modified it, the event’s user will be user B. Note: Some events are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API consumers should make sure to handle this case.  The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks contained within the project.  **Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields `Event.action` and `Event.change.action`. `Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information within the resource's fields have been modified.  For instance, consider these scenarios:   * When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be `added`, `Event.parent` will be on object with the `id` and `type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.   * When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`, `Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `new_value` will be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.   * When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`, `Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.
